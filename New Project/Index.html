            <img src="Assets/Images/gold 4.jpg" style="width: 400px;">
            <h2>Types of Gold</h2>
            <p>Gold Filled, also called Gold Overlay, refers to a layer of at least 10-Karat gold that has been
                permanently bonded by heat and pressure to one or more surfaces of the support metal, then rolled or
                drawn to a prescribed thickness. The Karat gold must be at least 1/10th of the total weight. Gold Plate
                means that a layer of plating of 10+ Karat gold has been bonded to a base metal. The Karat gold content
                may be less than 1/20th, but it must be properly identified by weight in terms of total metal content.
                Gold Leaf is just gold plating that's been pounded and applied by hand.</p>

            <div class="gold">
                <h2>Yellow Gold</h2>
                <img src="Assets/Images/gold 1.jpg" style="background-color: white; width: 300px;">
                <p>Yellow gold is alloyed with copper, zinc and silver. It is malleable, ductile, and generally
                    non-corrosive, so it has a high melting point and is not susceptible to compression.</p>

                <h2>White Gold</h2>
                <img src="Assets/Images/gold 2.jpg" style="background-color: white; width: 300px;">
                <p>White gold is alloyed with copper, zinc and nickel. The percentage of gold naturally varies,
                    according to the amount of other metal used. It is frequently used in diamond jewellery and
                    considered a classic metal choice. White gold is highly reflective and not subject to tarnish.</p>

                <h2>Rose Gold</h2>
                <img src="Assets/Images/gold 3.jpg" style=" width: 300px;">
                <p>Rose gold (also known as pink gold) is alloyed with copper, and in some cases silver. The proportions
                    are about one part of copper to three parts of 24-karat gold.</p>

                <h1>SILVER</h1>
                <hr>
                <img src="Assets/Images/silver 1.jpg" style=" width: 300px;">
                <h2>Types of Silver</h2>
                <h3>Sterling Silver</h3>
                <p>Sterling silver is the most common and found in most silver jewelry. Sterling silver is made up of
                    92.5% pure silver and 7.5% copper. The addition of copper makes sterling silver hard and also
                    malleable, making it easy to work with and create different kinds of jewelry such as necklaces,
                    rings, bracelets, and earrings. You'll want to be sure you are purchasing real sterling silver
                    before handing over your credit card. All sterling silver pieces are marked and stamped with a .925
                    or an abbreviation of "sterling" to let you know it's real.</p>

                <h3>Fine Silver</h3>
                <p>Fine silver is the purest form of silver at 99.9%. Fine silver may seem like the best type of silver
                    to use for jewelry, but it is actually a very soft metal. Because of this, it can be easily damaged
                    and can change form over time.</p>

                <h3>Silver Plate</h3>
                <p>The metal that makes up a silver-plated product is not actually silver, but another metal that is
                    then covered with a thin silver plate on top. Depending on the type of metal used, such as copper,
                    your jewelry can be pretty durable. However, because it is only a coating, silver-plated jewelry can
                    tarnish easily. Silver-plated jewelry is considered a lower-quality silver and is therefore much
                    less expensive than sterling.</p>

            <hr>
            <img src="Assets/Images/Diamond.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>Types of Diamonds</h2>
            <h3>Natural Diamonds</h3>
            <p>Regular white colorless diamonds. Not much to expand on them. Basically, these are probably what everybody imagine when you speak with them about diamonds.</p>
            <h3>Lab Grown Diamonds</h3>
            <p>Lab grown diamonds also known as man-made diamonds are somewhat of a growinng trend that is developing more and more last few years. The reason is that it is a technological product just like any other “gadget” (no disrespect intended). As such, as technology evolved, these diamonds become cheaper and cheaper to manufacture. While once prices of lab grown diamonds were 30% beneath equivalent regular diamonds, today they are 50%-60% cheaper and some say that in just a few years they will become even 70% cheaper and more.</p>
